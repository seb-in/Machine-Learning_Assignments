## Predicting the percentage of marks a student will acquire on the basis of the number of hours he/she studied.


## Introduction

With this Supervised Machine Learning Model, a student's percentage score is predicted using a Linear Regression Model after it is being trained with a dataset url "http://bit.ly/w-data"


## Steps Involved

* Initially, the relationship between the student mark percentage and the number of hours they have studied are analysed using graphichal representations.

* Next step is to split the data for training and testing.

* Then a machine learningn linear regression model is created and trained which is ready to make predictions.

* After making predictions, a comparative study between predicted scores and actual scores is done.

* The created machine learnig model at this stage could answer to a question: 

  What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?

* Towards the final stage, the model accuracy is tested by calculating Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.


## Conclusion

A machine learning model is acceptable if both the values of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error are minimum.
