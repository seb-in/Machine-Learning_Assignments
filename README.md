## Predicting the percentage of marks a student will acquire on the basis of the number of hours he/she studied.


## Introduction

With this Supervised Machine Learning Model,a student's score is predicted using a Linear Regression Model after it is being trained with a dataset url "http://bit.ly/w-data


## Steps Involved

* Initially, relationships between student score and number of hours studied are being studied using graphichal representations.

* Then the model after being trained with a training dataset is all set to predict student scores.

* After making predictions, we could make a comparitive study between our predicted sores and testing data.

* The created machine learnig model at this stage could answer to a question: 
  What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

* Towards the final stage, the model accuracy is tested by calculating Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.


## Conclusion

A machine learning model is acceptable if both the values of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error are minimum.
